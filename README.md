Standalone SuperCollider for BeagleBone Black Debian.

This is the audio synthesis program [SuperCollider](http://github.com/supercollider/supercollider) (master branch commit 617f980, 21feb2016) compiled for armv7l.

It was built using [this guide](http://supercollider.github.io/development/building-beagleboneblack) on a **BeagleBone Black** under bone-debian-7.9-lxde-4gb-armhf-2015-11-12-4gb.img (Wheezy).

The standalone structure is loosely based on [Miguel Negr√£o's template](https://github.com/miguel-negrao/scStandalone). This standalone is self-contained and all files are in one directory.

NOTE: this standalone does not include the full SuperCollider IDE. For the IDE use [this](https://github.com/redFrik/supercolliderStandaloneBBB) repository.
