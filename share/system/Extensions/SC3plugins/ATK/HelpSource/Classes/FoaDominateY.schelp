DESCRIPTION::
Apply dominance to a first order ambisonic signal (B-format) along the y-axis.


NOTE::
link::Classes/FoaDominateY:: is usually called via the convenience wrapper link::Classes/FoaTransform::.
::



CLASSMETHODS::

METHOD:: ar

argument:: in
The B-format signal, an array: [w, x, y, z]

argument:: gain
Dominance gain, in dB.

argument:: mul
Output will be multiplied by this value.

argument:: add
This value will be added to the output.


discussion:: Positive values of strong::gain:: increase the gain at code:: [pi/2, 0] :: to strong::+gain:: dB, while decreasing the gain at code:: [-pi/2, 0] :: to strong::-gain::. This simultaneously results in a distortion of the image towards code:: [pi/2, 0] ::. Negative values of gain invert this distortion, distorting towards code:: [-pi/2, 0] :: . The default, 0, results in no change.
